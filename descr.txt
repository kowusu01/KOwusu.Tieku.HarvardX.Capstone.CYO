Adding more residuals
The main idea in model 1 is based on biases (effects). This can actually be looked at as a model based on residuals. Because a residual is the difference between the actual and predicted, what equation XXX is doing is first assuming that y=mu+e, where e is the irreducible error, cannot be reduced to improve the model, and does not change.  By having y = mu + bi +bu +e, we are simply adding  residual effects due to user behavoir and movie biases. However, there could be more residuals (effects or biases) that the model has not captured yet. One way to determine if there could be residuals that have not been added to the model (hence the model is not yet optimal), is to compute the residuals in the current model, and plot it against the predicted values. If there is no pattern in the plot, it means, there are no more effects (residuals) not accounted for in the current model. If there is a pattern the plot, it means there are residuals that can be added to the current model to improve it. Our task is to find them!

Our new model not becomes Yu,1= mu + bi + bu + puqi + e. The new term puqi is the new set of residuals to be added. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Single Value Decomposition (SVD) are some of the techniques for computing these residuals.

In this section, I use SVD to compute 50 models to compute the residuals and add them to model 1 to see if the model performance improves.
